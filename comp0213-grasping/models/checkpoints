# Checkpoints Directory

This directory is designated for storing model checkpoints during the training process of the machine learning model used for grasp success classification. 

## Purpose

- **Model Checkpoints**: Save the state of the model at various points during training to allow for recovery and evaluation later.
- **Evaluation**: Checkpoints can be used to assess model performance on validation datasets and for inference in the grasp planning process.

## Usage

- Ensure that checkpoints are saved periodically during training to avoid loss of progress.
- Use the saved checkpoints for fine-tuning or further training as needed.

## Note

This directory should be monitored for storage space, as model checkpoints can consume significant disk space over time.
